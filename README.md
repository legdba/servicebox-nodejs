# Overview
HTTP REST services for infra/containers testing: echo, leaks, CPU-intensive ops, backend usage, etc.

# Exposed REST Services

See full Swagger definition and sample CURL commands at http://yourhost:8080/api/v2/swagger.yaml
See Swagger-UI at http://yourhost:8080/docs/ (mind the final '/').

```

## GET /api/v2/leak/{size}
Leak {size} bytes of memory.

Sample request:
```
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/api/v2/leak/1024
```

## GET /api/v2/leak/free
Free all memory leaked by calls to /api/v2/leak/{size}.

Sample request:
```
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/api/v2/leak/free
```

## GET /api/v2/calc/sum/{id}/{value}
Sum {value} to {id} counter in and return the new value. The data is stored in the instance memory by defaul( statefull) and can be set to Cassandra or Redis to emulate a stateless 12-factor behavior.

Sample request:
```
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/api/v2/calc/sum/0/1
```

## GET /api/v2/calc/fibo-nth/{n}
Compute the n-th term of fibonacci", notes = "Compute the n-th term of fibonacci which is CPU intensive, expecially if {n} > 50.

Sample request:
```
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/api/v2/calc/fibo-nth/42
```

# Usage
The application runs either as a NodeJS application or as a Docker container.

## NodeJS
Get from GIT and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/legdba/servicebox-nodejs.git && cd servicebox-nodejs && npm install && npm test && npm start
```
Swagger API available at http://localhost:8080/swagger; use it to explore exposed services and how to use them.

Display help for more CLI details:
```
npm start -- --help
```

## Docker
Latest version is always available in Quai.io and can be used as a docker application:
```
docker run -ti -p :8080:8080 --rm=true quay.io/legdba/servicebox-nodejs:latest
```
Help available the usual way:
```
docker run -ti -p :8080:8080 --rm=true quay.io/legdba/servicebox-nodejs:latest --help
```
Swagger API documentation available on http://your_container_ip:8080/swagger

Note that in the docker registry each image is tagged with the branch name.
Initially the image tag contained the GIT commit ID, but this is a non-standard DockerHub/Quay.io feature and was available only through customer builds, which are a pain to manage and maintain.

## AWS Lambda
The application can run by defining AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
```

And then running
```
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/serverless deploy
```

This will deploy the application as an AWS lambda function bound to an API Gateway endpoint according to ```serverless.yml``` configuration. Serverless will display the HTTP endpoints once the deployed is successfull. Those endpoints can be used to send requests, postfixed with the application REST path. Example:

```
TODO
```

NOTE: the default configuration exposes a public REST service that anybody could calls without control, and you're going to be billed for any calls (AWS has a generous free tier though).

## Using a Backend

### Memory
This is the default. No configuration needed.

### Cassandra
To use cassandra as a backend add the following options:
```
--be-type=cassandra --be-opts='{"contactPoints":["46.101.16.49","178.62.87.192"]}'
```
Plain-text credentials can be set this way (no other credentials supported so far):
```
--be-type cassandra --be-opts '{"contactPoints":["52.88.93.64","52.89.85.132","52.89.133.153"], "authProvider":{"type":"PlainTextAuthProvider", "username":"username", "password":"p@ssword"}}'
```
Set load balancing policies:
```
--be-type cassandra --be-opts '{"contactPoints":["52.88.93.64","52.89.85.132","52.89.133.153"], "loadBalancingPolicy":{"type":"DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy","localDC":"DC_name_"}}'
```

### Redis-cluster
To use a redis cluster as a backend add the following options:
```
--be-type=redis-cluster --be-opts='{"drivercfg":[{"host":"localhost","port":"6379"}]}'
```

The "drivercfg" JSON param is the IORedis client JSON connection object.
Any IORedis config is supported. This is basically a list of of the cluster nodes
to connect to in order to discover the cluster topology. A single node can be
configured and this enough, but to improve reliability it is advised to configure
three (3) nodes.

Note that the redis cluster client will try to connect to the cluster until it succeeds.

### Redis-sentinel
To use a redis with sentinels as a backend add the following options:
```
--be-type=redis-sentinel --be-opts='{"drivercfg":{ "sentinels": [ {"host": "104.131.130.202", "port":26379}, {"host": "104.236.144.145", "port":26379}, {"host": "104.236.145.222", "port":26379} ], "name": "mymaster" }}'
```

The "drivercfg" JSON param is the IORedis client JSON connection object.
Any IORedis config is supported. This is basically a list of the sentinels to
connect to in order to discover the whole list of sentinels, masters and slaves.
While a single sentinel can be configured it is advised to configure 3 sentinels
to improve reliability.

Note that the redis client will try to connect to the groups until it succeeds.
