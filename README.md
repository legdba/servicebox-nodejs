# Overview
HTTP REST services for infra/containers testing: echo, leaks, CPU-intensive ops, backend usage, etc.

# Exposed REST Services

See full Swagger definition and sample CURL commands at http://yourhost:8080/api/v2/swagger.yaml
See Swagger-UI at http://yourhost:8080/docs/ (mind the final '/').

## GET /api/v2/echo/{message} or POST /api/v2/echo
Return back message.

Sample requests (both GET and POST)
```shell
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://192.168.59.103:8080/api/v2/echo/hello
curl -X POST  -H "Accept: Application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/api/v2/echo -d '{"message":"hello"}'
```

## GET /api/v2/echo/{message}/{delay}
Return back message after {delayms} milliseconds

Sample request:
```shell
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/api/v2/echo/hello/1000
```

## GET /api/v2/env/vars
Display REST server environment.

Sample request:
```shell
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/api/v2/env/vars
```

## GET /api/v2/env/vars/{name}
Return the server ENV value for variable {name}.

Sample request:
```shell
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/api/v2/env/vars/HOME

```shell
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/api/v2/calc/fibo-nth/42
```

# Usage
The application runs either as a NodeJS application or as a Docker container.

## NodeJS
Get from GIT and run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/legdba/servicebox-nodejs.git && cd servicebox-nodejs && npm install && npm test && npm start
```
Swagger API available at http://localhost:8080/swagger; use it to explore exposed services and how to use them.

Display help for more CLI details:
```shell
npm start -- --help
```

## Docker
Latest version is always available in Quai.io and can be used as a docker application:
```shell
docker run -ti -p :8080:8080 --rm=true quay.io/legdba/servicebox-nodejs:latest
```
Help available the usual way:
```shell
docker run -ti -p :8080:8080 --rm=true quay.io/legdba/servicebox-nodejs:latest --help
```
Swagger API documentation available on http://your_container_ip:8080/swagger

Note that in the docker registry each image is tagged with the branch name.
Initially the image tag contained the GIT commit ID, but this is a non-standard DockerHub/Quay.io feature and was available only through customer builds, which are a pain to manage and maintain.

## AWS Lambda (BETA)
The application can run by defining AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
```

And then running
```shell
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/serverless deploy
```

This will deploy the application as an AWS lambda function bound to an API Gateway endpoint according to ```serverless.yml``` configuration. Serverless will display the HTTP endpoints once the deployed is successfull. Those endpoints can be used to send requests, postfixed with the application REST path. Example:

```shell
curl -v https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/v2/echo/hello
```
NOTE: the default configuration exposes a public REST service that anybody could calls without control, and you're going to be billed for any calls (AWS has a generous free tier though).

### Known Problems

Lambda support is in beta only. The following problems are known:
- The 1st request fails; when AWS spins a new containers the request fails with a Cannot GET /api/v2/... message. Next requests work fine until AWS restart the container of start a new one.
- Calling ```serverless deploy``` with nodejs 4 cause the deployed function to be broken for some reason. Deployemnt is successfully tested with nodejs 7.5.0 only.
- The is not CI/CD on the lambda integration. Upon a git push the Circle+CI tests should be augmented to deploy a test function on AWS Lambda and test it with real requests.

### Testing Lambda locally

Run a local serverless server:
```shell
./node_modules/.bin/serverless offline
```

There is one significant difference with a real Lambda environment: severless offline re-instantiate the function on each call, while Lambda will keep it instanciated for a while. It should not be much a concern though as Lambda functions shall be stateless and disposable, so in that regard serverless offline behavior is sane as it enforces the worse case scenario.

## Using a Backend

### Memory
This is the default. No configuration needed.

### Cassandra
To use cassandra as a backend add the following options:
```shell
--be-type=cassandra --be-opts='{"contactPoints":["46.101.16.49","178.62.87.192"]}'
```
Plain-text credentials can be set this way (no other credentials supported so far):
```shell
--be-type cassandra --be-opts '{"contactPoints":["52.88.93.64","52.89.85.132","52.89.133.153"], "authProvider":{"type":"PlainTextAuthProvider", "username":"username", "password":"p@ssword"}}'
```
Set load balancing policies:
```shell
--be-type cassandra --be-opts '{"contactPoints":["52.88.93.64","52.89.85.132","52.89.133.153"], "loadBalancingPolicy":{"type":"DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy","localDC":"DC_name_"}}'
```

### Redis-cluster
To use a redis cluster as a backend add the following options:
```shell
--be-type=redis-cluster --be-opts='{"drivercfg":[{"host":"localhost","port":"6379"}]}'
```

The "drivercfg" JSON param is the IORedis client JSON connection object.
Any IORedis config is supported. This is basically a list of of the cluster nodes
to connect to in order to discover the cluster topology. A single node can be
configured and this enough, but to improve reliability it is advised to configure
three (3) nodes.

Note that the redis cluster client will try to connect to the cluster until it succeeds.

### Redis-sentinel
To use a redis with sentinels as a backend add the following options:
```shell
--be-type=redis-sentinel --be-opts='{"drivercfg":{ "sentinels": [ {"host": "104.131.130.202", "port":26379}, {"host": "104.236.144.145", "port":26379}, {"host": "104.236.145.222", "port":26379} ], "name": "mymaster" }}'
```

The "drivercfg" JSON param is the IORedis client JSON connection object.
Any IORedis config is supported. This is basically a list of the sentinels to
connect to in order to discover the whole list of sentinels, masters and slaves.
While a single sentinel can be configured it is advised to configure 3 sentinels
to improve reliability.

Note that the redis client will try to connect to the groups until it succeeds.

### DynamodDB

To use DynamoDB as a backend add the following options (make sure to replace value with your key, your secret and your region):
```shell
--be-type=dynamodb --be-opts='{"accessKeyId": "yourkey", "secretAccessKey": "yoursecret","region": "us-west-2", "apiVersion": "2012-08-10"}'
```

The DynamoDB shall have a ```servicebox``` table with a ```string``` ```id``` attribute as the primary key.

A local DynamoDB can be used for testing with this sample set of options:
```shell
--be-type=dynamodb --be-opts='{"region":"us-west-2","apiVersion":"2012-08-10","endpoint":{"protocol":"http:","host":"localhost:8000","port":8000,"hostname":"localhost","pathname":"/","path":"/","href":"http://localhost:8000/"}}'
```

A local DynamoDB can be run this way:
```shell
wget http://dynamodb-local.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dynamodb_local_latest.tar.gz
mkdir dynamodb
cd dynamodb
tar xvzf ../dynamodb_local_latest.tar.gz
java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib/ -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -inMemory
```

The servicebox table can be created with this code snippet:
```javascript
var aws = require('aws-sdk');
var opts = {"region":"localhost","apiVersion":"2012-08-10","endpoint":{"protocol":"http:","host":"localhost:8000","port":8000,"hostname":"localhost","pathname":"/","path":"/","href":"http://localhost:8000/"}};
aws.config.update(opts);
var dynamodb = new aws.DynamoDB(opts);

var createdb_params = {
  TableName: 'servicebox',
  AttributeDefinitions: [
       { AttributeName: 'id', AttributeType: 'S' }
       ],
  KeySchema:[
       { AttributeName: 'id', KeyType: 'HASH' }
  ],
  ProvisionedThroughput: {ReadCapacityUnits: 5, WriteCapacityUnits: 5},
};
dynamodb.createTable(createdb_params, function(err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(err, err.stack); // an error occurred
  else {
    console.log('created servicebox table');
    console.log(data);
  }
});
```

# Exposed services

Get Swagger definition at http://yourhost:8080/api/v2/swagger (this will return JSON or YAML based your Accept header).

# Security

Debug log level will log backend configuration strings, including credentials. Make sure NOT to use debug where this is a security issue.

# TODO
* Add txn logs
* Add support for Cassandra cluster options (same as in servicebod-jaxrs)
