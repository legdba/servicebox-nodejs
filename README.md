Note that in the docker registry each image is tagged with the git revision and commit of the code
used to generate the image. If you run quay.io/legdba/servicebox-nodejs:r23-7be1d82 this is the revision 'r23'
and commit '7be1d82'. The associated code can be seen at https://github.com/legdba/servicebox-nodejs/commit/7be1d82
or with a 'git 7be1d82' command when in the servicebox-nodejs repo.
