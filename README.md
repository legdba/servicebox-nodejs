# Overview
HTTP REST services for infra/containers testing: echo, leaks, CPU-intensive ops, backend usage, etc.

# Usage
The application runs either as a NodeJS application or as a Docker container.

## NodeJS
Get from GIT and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/legdba/servicebox-nodejs.git && cd servicebox-nodejs && npm install && npm test && npm start
```
Swagger API available at http://localhost:8080/swagger; use it to explore exposed services and how to use them.

Display help for more CLI details:
```
npm start -- --help
```

## Docker
Latest version is always available in Quai.io and can be used as a docker application:
```
docker run -ti -p :8080:8080 --rm=true quay.io/legdba/servicebox-nodejs:latest
```
Help available the usual way:
```
docker run -ti -p :8080:8080 --rm=true quay.io/legdba/servicebox-nodejs:latest --help
```
Swagger API documentation available on http://your_container_ip:8080/swagger

Note that in the docker registry each image is tagged with the git revision, commit and branch of the code
used to generate the image. If you run quay.io/legdba/servicebox-nodejs:r23-7be1d82-master this is the revision 'r23'
and commit '7be1d82' on branch 'master'. The associated code can be seen at https://github.com/legdba/servicebox-nodejs/commit/7be1d82
or with a 'git 7be1d82' command when in the servicebox-nodejs repo.

## Using a Backend

### Memory
This is the default. No configuration needed.

### Cassandra
To use cassandra as a backend add the following options:
```
--be-type=cassandra --be-opts='{"contactPoints":["46.101.16.49","178.62.87.192"]}'
```
Obviously use your own node IPs or names.
The --be-opts support any JSON string configuration supported by Cassandra JavaScript media driver (see https://github.com/datastax/java-driver).
